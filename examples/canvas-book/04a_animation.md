# Animation

## Animating with requestAnimationFrame


Now that we know how to draw lots of cool things, lets animate them. The first
thing to know about animation is that it's just drawing the same thing over and
over again. When you call a draw function it is immediately put up on the
screen. If you want to animate something, just wait a few milliseconds and draw
it again. Now of course you don't want to sit in a busy loop since that would
block the browser. Instead you should draw something then ask the browser to
call you back a split second later. The easiest way to do this is with the
JavaScript `setInterval()` function. It will call your drawing function every N
msecs.

However, we should never actually use `setInterval`. `setInterval` will always
draw at the same speed, regardless of what kind of computer the user has,
whatever else the user is doing, and whether or not the page is currently in the
foreground. In short, it works but it isn't efficient. Instead we should use a
newer API `requestAnimationFrame`.

`requestAnimationFrame` was created to make animation smooth and power
efficient. You call it with a reference to your drawing function. At some time
in the future the browser will call your drawing function when _the
browser_ is ready. This gives the browser complete control over drawing so it
can lower the framerate when needed. It also can make the animation smoother by
locking it to the 60 frames per second refresh rate of the screen.  To make
`requestAnimationFrame` a loop just call it recursively as the first thing.

requestAnimationFrame is now a standard but some older browsers only support
their own prefixed version of it. For example, Chrome uses
`webkitRequestAnimationFrame` and Mozilla supports `mozRequestAnimationFrame`.  To
fix this we will use [Paul Irish's shim script](http://paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/)
This just maps the different variations to a new
function: `requestAnimFrame`.

``` javascript
// shim layer with setTimeout fallback
window.requestAnimFrame = (function(){
  return  window.requestAnimationFrame       ||
          window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||
          window.mozRequestAnimationFrame    ||
          window.oRequestAnimationFrame      ||
          window.msRequestAnimationFrame     ||
          function( callback ){
            window.setTimeout(callback, 1000 / 60);
          };
})();
```

Lets try a simple example where we animate a rectangle across the screen.

``` javascript
var x = 0;
function drawIt() {
    window.requestAnimFrame(drawIt);
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
    var c = canvas.getContext('2d');
    c.fillStyle = 'red';
    c.fillRect(x,100,200,100);
    x+=5;
}
window.requestAnimFrame(drawIt);
```

{{
    type: "interactive"
    href: "examples/setinterval1.html"
    image: "examples/setinterval1.png"
    text: "basic animated rectangle using requestAnimFrame (click to run)"
}}

## Clearing the background


Now you'll notice a problem. Our rectangle does go across the screen, updating
by five pixels every 100 millesconds (or 10FPS), but the old rectangle is still
there. It looks like the rectangle is just getting longer and longer.  Remember
that the canvas is just a pixel buffer. If you set some pixels they will stay
there until you change them. So lets clear the canvas on each frame before we
draw the rectangle.

``` javascript
var x = 0;
function drawIt() {
    window.requestAnimFrame(drawIt);
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
    var c = canvas.getContext('2d');
    <b>c.clearRect(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height);</b>
    c.fillStyle = "red";
    c.fillRect(x,100,200,100);
    x+=5;
}

window.requestAnimFrame(drawIt);
```

{{
    type: "interactive"
    href: "examples/setinterval2.html"
    image: "examples/setinterval2.png"
    text: "drawing rectangle with background clearing (click to run)"
}}

## Particle Simulator


So that's really all there is to animation. Drawing something over and over
again.  Lets try something a bit more complicated: a particle simulator.  We
want to have some particles fall down the screen like snow.  To do that we will
implement the classic particle simulator algorithm:

![particle simulator](chapter4/particles.png).screenshot

A particle simulator has a list of particles that it loops over. On every frame
it updates the position of each particle based on some equation, then kills /
creates particles as needed based on some condition. Then it draws the
particles.  Here's a simple snow example.


``` javascript
var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
var particles = [];
var tick = 0;
function loop() {
    window.requestAnimFrame(loop);
    createParticles();
    updateParticles();
    killParticles();
    drawParticles();
}
window.requestAnimFrame(loop);
```

First we will create the essence of a particle simulator. It's a loop function
that is called every 30 ms. The only data structure we need is an empty array of
particles and a clock tick counter. Every time through the loop it will execute
the four parts.


``` javascript
function createParticles() {
    //check on every 10th tick check
    if(tick % 10 == 0) {
        //add particle if fewer than 100
        if(particles.length &lt; 100) {
            particles.push({
                    x: Math.random()*canvas.width, //between 0 and canvas width
                    y: 0,
                    speed: 2+Math.random()*3, //between 2 and 5
                    radius: 5+Math.random()*5, //between 5 and 10
                    color: &quot;white&quot;,
            });
        }
    }
}
```

The `createParticles` function will check if there are less than 100 particles.
If so it will create a new particle. Notice that it only executes every 10th
tick. This lets the screen start off empty and slowly build up, rather than
creating all 100 particles right at the start. You would adjust this depending
on the effect you are going for. I'm using `Math.random()` and some arithmetic
to make sure the snow flakes are in different positions and don't look the same.
This will make the snow feel more natural.

``` javascript
function updateParticles() {
    for(var i in particles) {
        var part = particles[i];
        part.y += part.speed;
    }
}
```

The `updateParticles` function is very simple. It simply updates
the y coordinate of each particle by adding it's speed. This will move the snow
flake down the screen.

``` javascript
function killParticles() {
    for(var i in particles) {
        var part = particles[i];
        if(part.y > canvas.height) {
            part.y = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

Here is `killParticles`. It checks if the particle is below the bottom of the
canvas. In some simulators you would kill the particle and remove it from the
list. Since this app will show continuous snow instead we will recycle the
particle by setting the y back to 0.

``` javascript
function drawParticles() {
    var c = canvas.getContext('2d');
    c.fillStyle = "black";
    c.fillRect(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height);
    for(var i in particles) {
        var part = particles[i];
        c.beginPath();
        c.arc(part.x,part.y, part.radius, 0, Math.PI*2);
        c.closePath();
        c.fillStyle = part.color;
        c.fill();
    }
}
```

Finally we draw the particles. Again it's very simple: clear the background
then draw a circle with the current particle's x, y, radius, and color.

Now here's what it looks like:

{{
    type: "interactive"
    href: "examples/snowsim.html"
    image: "examples/snowsim.png"
    text: "Particle simulation of snow falling"
}}


What I love about particle simulators is that you can create very complicated
and organic, natural looking animation with very simple math, combined with a
bit of carefully chosen randomness.



## Sprite Animation

# What is a Sprite?

The final major kind of animation is sprite animation.  So what is a sprite?

A sprite is a small image that you can draw quickly to the screen. Usually a
sprite is actually cut out of a larger image called a sprite sheet or master
image. This sheet might contain multiple sprites of different things, like the
different characters in a game. A sprite sheet might also contain the same
character in different poses. This is what gives you different frames of
animation. This is the classic flip-book style of animation: simply flip through
different drawings over and over.

# Why and When to use Sprites?

Sprites are good for a few of things.

* First, a sprite is an image so it will probably draw faster than vectors, especially if those are complicated vectors.
* Second: sprites are great for when you need to draw the same thing over and over. For example, in a space invaders kind of game you probably have a bunch of bullets on the screen that all look the same. It's very fast to load a bullet sprite once and draw it over and over.
* Third: sprites are fast to download and draw as part of a sheet. It lets you download a single image for your entire set of sprites, which will download much faster than getting a bunch of separate images.  They typically also compress better. Finally, it uses less memory to have one large image than a bunch of smaller ones.
* Finally: sprites are great for working with animation that comes out of a drawing tool such as photoshop. the code simply flips between images but it doesn't care what is in the image. This means your artist could easily update the graphics and animation without touching the code. Just drop in a new sprite sheet and you are set.

# Drawing Sprites

Sprites are easy to draw using the `drawImage` function.  This function can draw
and stretch a portion of an image by specifying different source and destination
coordinates.  For example, suppose we have this sprite sheet and we just want to
draw the sprite in the center (5th from the left).

![sprite sheet](chapter4/sprite.png).screenshot


We can draw just this sprite by specifying source coordinates:

``` javascript
context.drawImage(
    img,        // the image of the sprite sheet
    65,0,13,13, // source coordinates      (x,y,w,h)
     0,0,13,13,  // destination coordinates (x,y,w,h)
    );
```

# Sprite Animation

As you can see in the full sprite sheet, this is really the same object drawn in
different frames of an animation, so now let's flip through the different
sprites to make it be animated. We'll do this by keeping track of the current
frame using a tick counter.

``` javascript
var frame = tick % 10;
var x = frame * 13;
context.drawImage(
    img,        // the image of the sprite sheet
    x,0,13,13, // source coordinates      (x,y,w,h)
    0,0,13,13,  // destination coordinates (x,y,w,h)
    );
tick++;
```

Every time the screen is updated we calculate the current frame animation by
looking at the tick. Doing a mod (%) 10 operation means the frame will loop from
0 to 9 over and over.  Then we calculate an x coordinate based on the frame
number. Then draw the image and update the tick counter.  Of course this might
go too fast, so you could divide the tick by 2 or 3 before the mod to make it
run slower.

    type:  "interactive"
    href:  "examples/spriteanim.html"

}}

In the next chapter we will build a simple game.  This game will demonstrate how
to use basic and sprite animation, keyboard events, and a simple particle
simulator for explosions.
